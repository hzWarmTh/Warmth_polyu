# What I Learned
In this exercise, I learned how to use GitHub Codespaces as a cloud-based development environment and leveraged GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode to build a complete personal website. I gained hands-on experience with version control commands (git add, commit, push) and learned how GitHub Actions automates the deployment process to GitHub Pages. It was fascinating to see how providing a simple blueprint (aboutme.md) allowed the AI to generate the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure instantly.

# AI Experience & Evaluation
The AI output exceeded my expectations. It correctly interpreted my markdown file and created a responsive layout without needing me to write the boilerplate code manually.

What worked well: The Agent Mode was particularly impressive because it could edit multiple files (HTML, CSS, JS) simultaneously, ensuring the styles and scripts were correctly linked.

Unexpected challenges: Initially, I wasn't sure if the deployment was working. I learned that I needed to check the "Actions" tab to monitor the build progress, which was a new concept for me.

# Most Useful Technique
The most effective technique I found was creating a comprehensive "Context File" (aboutme.md) before asking the AI to write any code. By organizing my personal information, skills, and image links into a clear markdown structure first, I minimized the need for corrections. The prompt "Read aboutme.md... Generate index.html, styles.css, and script.js" was very powerful because it grounded the AI's creativity in my actual data.
